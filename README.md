## About

Bluespiral is a small UCI based chess engine project built from scratch to analyze chess positions.

## UCI

"UCI is an open communication protocol for chess engines to play games automatically, that is to communicate with other programs including Graphical User Interfaces. UCI was designed and developed by Rudolf Huber and Stefan Meyer-Kahlen [1], and released in November 2000 [2]. It has, by-in-large, replaced the older Chess Engine Communication Protocol (WinBoard/XBoard)." (ChessProgramming.org)
